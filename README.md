## Features

### Cards

A lot of times content is displayed using cards. The basic ``Card`` component is used for almost anything on the page.

There are also more complex versions of the base, like the ``ShadowCard`` component, which extends the base with a ``ShadowBox`` component. It is used for every card that has a shadow behind the content.

### Blocks

Blocks represent a reusable collection of multiple components, that are always put together in the same way. An example would be the ``ProjectPreview`` block that is used to preview a project. Blocks are used in lists (ex. previewing multiple projects).

### Sections

The page is divided into unique sections, such as the  ``Work`` section. They then act as static templates, that use blocks and components to display the information provided to them.
